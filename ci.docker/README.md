# Dockerfiles for CI testing (with artefacts)

This folder contains the base image for CI testing. The main app image is at the root of the repository named `artefacts.Dockerfile`

1. A base image for all deps and initial pixi install
2. The app image which redoes pixi install (fast, as only code changes)

## Build

Build the app image with
```
docker build -t omnilrs . -f artefacts.Dockerfile  
```

## Running tests

Tests can be ran with the `CMD` line of `artefacts.dockerfile` being either
```
CMD ["pixi", "run", "test-ros2"] # pytest
CMD artefacts run $ARTEFACTS_JOB_NAME # with artefacts
```
and can be ran from the command line with:
```
docker run --gpus all omnilrs  # pytest
artefacts run --in-container test-ros2 --dockerfile artefacts.Dockerfile --gpus=all # artefacts
```

## Notes for Building the Base Image

If you wish to build the base image (`Dockerfile.base`) yourself, note that assets (git lfs) and git submodules must already be available on the machine you are building on.
